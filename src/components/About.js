                    <p className="py-6">I'm a software
                        developer with a passion for creating intuitive and
                        user-friendly applications. I have been using computers
                        for most of my life and have strong
                        computer science foundations. In the past year, I have
                        gained practical programming experience through various
                        projects and junior roles, and am always eager to learn
                        and improve my skills.</p>

                        I graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Madison
                        with a B.S. in Conservation Biology and a certification
                        in Archaeology.  I've come a long way from there and am
                        thankful for the opportunity to develop a
                        unique perspective and approach to problems. In the
                        past year I secured an associate software developer
                        position and completed two
                        different software development bootcamps specializing
                        in the MERN tech stack and CNET/Angular.

                        friends and family to play, walking my cats in their wagon,
                        and going on trips with my friends.
